For this challenge, the player was given two files, the malware executable and the source c code.
The task was: determining the malware type/purpose, the target server's IP/port, a commented flag, and the malware buffer sized (number of chars it sends to the server per request).
Right away when scanning the source code and reading the function names, you realize it has something to do with keyboard from the "KeyboardProc" function. And indeed, when you get down to the "main" function, the malware's objectif will become obvious.
First, it sets the "hThread" object to handle the fake installation process. Then, the "hHook" object is defined to set the keyboard hook.
