# Description
Now you are ready to be a detective in a real murder case. Read the tasks descriptions very well to solve the case.
Save every flag you find in a text file because you might need it far into the story (but not this flag).
when writing the flags make sure that every word starts in upper case (the killer loves the first letters) and replace evry space with a"_":  
PLEASE PLAY THEM IN THE RIGHT ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY.

example flag: Securinets{Example_Flag}
