Now you are ready to be a detective in a real muder case. Read the tasks descriptions very well to solve the case.
Save every flag you find in a text file because you might needed it far into the story (but not this flag).
when writing the flags make sure that every world starts in upper case (the killer loves the first letters) and replace evry space with a"_":  
PLEASE PLAY THEM IN THE RIGHT ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY
