        <h2>Emergency!</h2>
        <p>
            We are experiencing a technical problem at the hospital when people come in to receive the vaccine.
            Unfortunately, our production system has crashed, and all the patients' information is lost. We
            need to quickly insert patient data into a temporary database. Our emergency API isn't quite
            ready yet, but we can support XML submissions. Currently, we are storing data in
            <kbd>/patients</kbd> and <kbd>/doctors</kbd> before we integrate those into the production API.
        </p>
