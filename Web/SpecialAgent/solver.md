# Solver :

we inspect the web page to find a comment hidden in the <head> tag , we notice that the comment talks about agents , so tht means its talking about userAgent , it also gives us an agent , witch is SpecialAgent , we can then send an http request in witch we change the user agent to **SpecialAgent** and we get a webpage containing the flag
