The British Empire, at its height in the 19th and early 20th centuries, was one of the strongest empires in history, spanning about a quarter of the Earth's total land area. Known for its motto "the empire on which the sun never sets," it played a major role in shaping the modern world through colonization, trade, and cultural influence. The empire's legacy continues to impact global politics, economics, and culture to this day.
